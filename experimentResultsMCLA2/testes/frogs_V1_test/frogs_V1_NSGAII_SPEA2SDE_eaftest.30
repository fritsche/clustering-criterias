Using default random seed
Read 60 rows, 1820 columns
Assuming 2 sets of 30 runs each

First-order EAF KS-like two-sample two-sided test
==================================================

Test statistic = 30/30
               = 1

Using 10000 random permutations to estimate null distribution
Please be patient... done.

Critical value = 12/30
               = 0.4

p-value = 0

Decision: REJECT the null hypothesis
